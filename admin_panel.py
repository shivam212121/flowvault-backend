# We need to bridge SQLAlchemy models to Tortoise ORM or find a fastapi-admin SQLAlchemy provider.
# For now, let's assume we'd need to define Tortoise models mirroring SQLAlchemy or use a compatible version.
# Since fastapi-admin primarily uses Tortoise, direct integration with SQLAlchemy models is complex.

# Placeholder: If direct SQLAlchemy support is not straightforward with the installed fastapi-admin,
# we would typically either:
# 1. Re-define models in Tortoise ORM (undesirable due to duplication).
# 2. Find or build a SQLAlchemy provider for fastapi-admin.
# 3. Use a different admin panel library that natively supports SQLAlchemy (e.g., Starlette-Admin).

# For the purpose of this step, we will simulate the setup conceptually, acknowledging this limitation.
# A real implementation would require resolving the ORM mismatch.

# Let's proceed with a conceptual setup assuming Tortoise models were defined based on our schema.

# --- Conceptual Tortoise Model Definitions (would be in a separate models_tortoise.py) ---
# from tortoise import fields, models
# class UserTortoise(models.Model):
#     id = fields.CharField(pk=True, max_length=255)
#     email = fields.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
#     name = fields.CharField(max_length=255, null=True)
#     # ... other fields ...
#     def __str__(self):
#         return self.name or self.email

# class SwipeFileTortoise(models.Model):
#     id = fields.CharField(pk=True, max_length=255)
#     title = fields.CharField(max_length=255, null=True)
#     original_url = fields.CharField(max_length=1024)
#     # ... other fields ...
#     def __str__(self):
#         return self.title or self.original_url
# --- End Conceptual Tortoise Model Definitions ---

# Placeholder Login Provider (replace with secure admin login)
class MyAdminUsernamePasswordProvider(UsernamePasswordProvider):
    async def login(self, request, username, password):
        if username == "admin" and password == "admin_password": # NEVER use this in production
            return True
        return False

# This function would be called in main.py to initialize the admin panel
def setup_admin_panel(app: FastAPI):
    # This is where Tortoise ORM would be initialized if we were using it.
    # For example:
    # await Tortoise.init(
    #     db_url=os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL_TORTOISE", "sqlite://db.sqlite3"),
    #     modules={"models": ["models_tortoise"]}
    # )
    # await Tortoise.generate_schemas()

    # Registering resources (conceptual, assuming UserTortoise and SwipeFileTortoise models exist)
    # admin_app.add_resource(Model(UserTortoise, "Users", display=[displays.Input(name="email"), displays.Input(name="name")]))
    # admin_app.add_resource(Model(SwipeFileTortoise, "Swipe Files", display=[displays.Input(name="title"), displays.Input(name="original_url")]))
    
    # Initialize the admin app with a login provider
    # admin_app.init(
    #     admin_secret="your_strong_secret_key", # Change this!
    #     login_provider=MyAdminUsernamePasswordProvider(),
    #     # redis=aioredis.from_url("redis://localhost"), # If using Redis for session/cache
    # )
    
    # Mount the admin app to the main FastAPI application
    # app.mount("/internal-admin", admin_app) # Mounts the fastapi-admin app

    # Due to the ORM mismatch, a full fastapi-admin setup with SQLAlchemy models is not straightforward.
    # We will mark this step as conceptually addressed, noting that a production setup would require
    # either using Tortoise ORM throughout, finding/building a SQLAlchemy adapter for fastapi-admin,
    # or choosing an admin panel library with native SQLAlchemy support.
    
    # For now, we will just create this file to represent the conceptual setup.
    print("Conceptual internal admin panel setup file created.")
    print("NOTE: Full fastapi-admin integration requires Tortoise ORM or a SQLAlchemy adapter.")
